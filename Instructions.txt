			INSTRUCTIONS

1. The packet input is checked according to the given firewall rules. 
----> Reject overrides "Drop" and "Drop" overrides "Allow".
----> Message displayed when packet is allowed/dropped/rejected:
   a. Allow: "Packet is Allowed."
   b. Drop : It is given the packet is dropped silently so we just give the message that "packet is dropped" without giving the reason.
    c. Rejected: "Packet is rejected" along with the reason.

2. Within Reject/Allow/Deny, it has been assumed that packet is rejected/allowed/dropped even when one condition matches.
	i.e. If Source IP Address meets the reject condition, packet is dropped irrespective of other arguments of packet.

3. IP Addresses are given in just Decimal Format (IT IS ASSUMED PACKET HAS ALREADY IP ADDRESSES CONVERTED TO DECIMAL)

4. If the adapter of the packet doesn't match the adapt_list then no rules are applied on packet and it is allowed by default.If 'any' keyword is given in adapter paramter in packet, it means rules will be applied on the packet.  

5. VLan id is just checked for allowed and deny(dropped) as mentioned in firewall clause syntax.

6. If ICMP is not given in packet (i.e. ICMP code is set to 0) then reject message displayed is with ICMP code and type as 0 else reject message is displayed with ICMP Code and type provided.
6. Protocol allowed are only TCP,UDP,ICMP. Rest of them are dropped (silently). Protocol Id is given just in decimal form and not string.

7. Adapter ID has been mapped from A-H to 1-8.

8. IP Address are mapped to decimal numbers 1 to 2^32 for ipV4 and 1 to 2^128 for ipV6.
